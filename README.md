# Control Engineering
## [Ball & Beam Control System](https://github.com/fardinabbasi/Ball_and_Beam_Control_System)
Implementation and analysis of a Ball & Beam Control System, including system modeling, linearization, controllability, observability, and the design of controllers and observers, with a focus on stabilizing the system using PID controllers, state feedback, and estimators to handle nonlinearities, disturbances.
## [Magnetic Levitation Control System](https://github.com/fardinabbasi/Electromagnetic_Levitation_Control_System)
Modeling and analyzing a magnetic levitation system, including the design and evaluation of PID and PI controllers to achieve stability and desired performance in both time and frequency domains.
